## Calgary & Edmonton Weather Comparison

### Purpose/Motivation:
There are several reasons to investigate the weather change in Calgary vs. Edmonton:  
- To determine if Alberta’s local environment is trending the same way as the global warming over the past 30 years. Earth’s temperature has risen by 0.08° C per decade since 1880 (Lindsey, R and Dahlman, L., 2021). Global warming is a serious threat that will cause things such as a rise in warm temperature extremes, an increase in heatwaves occurring more naturally, risks of floods and droughts (depending on the location), negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems, and less food availability (Buis, A. (2019)). This leads us to the first question we want to answer: Is Alberta’s local weather trending the same way as the global warming over the past 30 years?  
- To investigate Calgary’s local weather patterns. For example, this information can be used to provide educated advice (like travel tips, what to pack, what to expect) for different seasons in Calgary. This leads us to the second question we want to answer: What are Calgary’s local weather patterns like? What advice would be suggested to travelers coming to Calgary for each season?  
- To investigate if Calgary and Edmonton have similar weather. Since the two cities are geograph- ically closed to each other, it is likely that there is the belief that they are theoretically quite correlated in terms of weather. As such, the strength of this association will be explored to see if data in one location can be used to to predict the other. This leads us to the third question we want to answer: How do Calgary and Edmonton’s weather compare?
